# Chat Program
# Text server and client programs using TCP
# Author: Dylan Carr

These two programs fuction together as a text-based chat service. Each instance of the chat client connects to the server using its specified port, and is then able to send and receive messages to other users through the server.

Available commands for clients are as follows:

%M <user> <message> To send a message to a given user

%B <message> To broadcast a message to all online users

%L To request a list of users currently online

%E To safely disconnect and exit the client


To compile:

$ make                  (for both)
-or-
$ make server/cclient   (for one or the other)


To run server:

$ ./server [optional-port-number]

which prints the port number used (either random or specified by the user) and runs continuously.


To run the client:

$ ./cclient <username> <server-name/address> <server-port>

if the connection is successful, use the commands above to talk to other clients.
